# form-valdiation
I have done project under the topic Form validation using html css and JavaScript... In my project the form that validates Name,email, phone number, password, confirm password.I have used HTML skills in layout the page,by using css I have given amazing background color,font,and when we hover button called"Submit" gets changed to another color .By using javascript,I have done functions like "Name" in form were user can enter their name more than 5 character, empty strings not allowed,more than 14 character not allowed.In email function correct email are allowed,In phone number function,it alows 10 digit numbers only,In password function it should contain 7 characters and should be same as confirm password function.After filling the correct statement it shows tick symbol icon on the right of the answers,after that when we click submit button alert message will be appears saying "successfully completed"
